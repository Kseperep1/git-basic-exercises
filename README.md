This project contains a few examples of how to use GIT.

1. I created a new directory and initialized it using (git init). I then moved over to checking the status of my repo
(git status) and then created a new blank file in my directory (touch "name"). I then staged and unstaged my README 
file (git add)() and all throughout checking the status of my repo. At the end I commited my staged file.

2. I used the nano text editor to edit my file (nano "name") (^x) and saved it with written texts (y - enter) then printed 
them out on the console (cat). I then did a second and a third commit after editing my file the second time.

3. I checked for all my commits (git log) which all had a alphanumeric hash string.
